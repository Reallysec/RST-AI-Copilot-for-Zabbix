#          --mirror github|cn   github: GitHub Releases only; cn: China mirror (Tencent COS) first,
#                               GitHub second. Default: GitHub first, the China mirror when it fails.
#                               Same as env RST_MIRROR=github|cn.
#          --download-only   verify and save the archive in the current directory, deploy nothing
#                            (carry it to an air-gapped host and run deploy.sh there)
#
# Every edition is the same archive: without a license it runs as the Community Edition;
# importing a license in Settings -> License unlocks Professional or Enterprise in place.
# Every release is checked against its signed manifest (release-manifest.token, signed with
# the Reallysec release key embedded below): the archive must match the signed sha256, or
# nothing is installed. Without --version the newest signed release is installed (a release
# whose manifest is not uploaded yet, minutes after the build, is skipped with a message).
# Re-running it (a newer version) keeps .env and state/machine-id in the install directory.
